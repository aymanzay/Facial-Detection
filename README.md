# Facial-Detection
Android Application that demonstrates realtime facial detection and speech recognition capabilities.

My motivation behind building this application stems from my research on mobile assistive technologies.
I wanted to create an application that could serve as an assistive platform for users with disabilities to be able to either be able
to navigate their phone through speech to ease any potential strain on finger mobility, as well as be able to have their phone
tell them who may be in front of them by using the facial detection.

Application demonstrates ability to detect multiple faces in realtime using the Google Mobile Vision API.
It is also able to listen to user speech and perform actions, such as "Turn on Camera", "Go home", ect.

It is far from complete but would I like to revisit and revise this idea to synthesize a feasible alternative for disabled users.
